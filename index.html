 <h1>About Food</h1>
 <img src="png/paleo_dieta.jpg" alt="An example of food" width="400" height="250" style="float: right; padding: 10px 20px;
   border-radius: 10px; border-style:groove; background-color: aliceblue;"><br>
 <p style="font-size: 20px;">Food is any substance consumed to provide nutritional support for an organism. Food is usually of plant, animal or fungal origin, and contains essential nutrients, such as carbohydrates, fats, proteins, vitamins, or minerals. </p>
 <br>
 <p style="font-size: 19px;"> Historically, humans secured food through two main methods: hunting and gathering and agriculture.
    As agricultural technologies increased, humans settled into agriculture lifestyles with diets shaped by the agriculture opportunities in their geography. 
    Geographic and cultural differences has led to creation of numerous cuisines and culinary arts, including a wide array of ingredients, herbs, spices, techniques, and dishes. 
    As cultures have mixed through forces like international trade and globalization, ingredients have become more widely available beyond their geographic and cultural origins, creating a cosmopolitan exchange of different food traditions and practices.</p>

<h1>Food sources</h1>
<p style="font-size: 19px;">Most food has its origin in plants. Some food is obtained directly from plants; but even animals that are used as food sources are raised by feeding them food derived from plants</p>
<p style="font-size: 19px;">Some foods not from animal or plant sources include various edible fungi, especially mushrooms. Fungi and ambient bacteria are used in the preparation of fermented and pickled foods like leavened bread, alcoholic drinks, cheese, pickles, kombucha, and yogurt.</p>
<h2>Plants.</h2>
<img src="png/History-of-the-Term-Whole-Food-Plant-Based-Nutrition.jpg" width="400" height="244" style="float: right; padding: 19px 25px; border-radius: 10px;
border-style:groove; background-color: aliceblue;">
<div class="plants" style="font-size: 19px;">
<p>Many plants and plant parts are eaten as food and around 2,000 plant species are cultivated for food. </p>
   <p> Seeds of plants are a good source of food for animals, including humans, because they contain the nutrients necessary for the plant's initial growth, including many healthful fats, such as omega fats. In fact, the majority of food consumed by human beings are seed-based foods. 
    Edible seeds include cereals (corn, wheat, rice, et cetera), legumes (beans, peas, lentils, et cetera), and nuts. Oilseeds are often pressed to produce rich oils - sunflower, flaxseed, rapeseed (including canola oil), sesame, et cetera.   </p>
   <p> Fruits are the ripened ovaries of plants, including the seeds within. Many plants and animals have coevolved such that the fruits of the former are an attractive food source to the latter, because animals that eat the fruits may excrete the seeds some distance away. Fruits, therefore, make up a significant part of the diets of most cultures. Some botanical fruits, such as tomatoes, pumpkins, and eggplants, are eaten as vegetables.</p>
   <p> Vegetables are a second type of plant matter that is commonly eaten as food. These include root vegetables (potatoes and carrots), bulbs (onion family), leaf vegetables (spinach and lettuce), stem vegetables (bamboo shoots and asparagus), and inflorescence vegetables (globe artichokes and broccoli and other vegetables such as cabbage or cauliflower).</p>

<h2>Animals.</h2>

border-style:groove; background-color: aliceblue;">
<p style="font-size: 19px;">Animals are used as food either directly or indirectly by the products they produce. Meat is an example of a direct product taken from an animal, which comes from muscle systems or from organs</p>
<br>
<p style="font-size: 19px;">Food products produced by animals include milk produced by mammary glands, which in many cultures is drunk or processed into dairy products (cheese, butter, etc.). In addition, birds and other animals lay eggs, which are often eaten, and bees produce honey, a reduced nectar from flowers, which is a popular sweetener in many cultures. Some cultures consume blood, sometimes in the form of blood sausage, as a thickener for sauces, or in a cured, salted form for times of food scarcity, and others use blood in stews such as jugged hare</p>
